# terraform-google-gcve-mon

## Introduction

This Terraform module will create a GCVE monitoring agent that can be used in your GCVE project to send logs into Cloud Operations. The agent will be created in the project that you specify as per the example.


## Configuration

The module will create a VM Instance called `gcve-mon` by default, and it will create a service account called `gcve-mon-sa` by default. Both can be changed by specifiy in the variable when calling the module.

You should place the password for your vCenter instance into a secret in secret manager within the same project that VMWare Engine is operating. The secret is `vc_password` by default however you can can specify another name.

The subnetwork you attach this to **MUST** have Private Network Access enabled, as a public ip is not created. This is likely preferrable as it is recommended to keep the VM Instance as secure as possible.

## Dashboards

Google supplies a number of pre-built dashboards that can be used to monitor your GCVE project. They are called;
- GCVE Overview
- GCVE Virtual Machine Performance
- GCVE Contention
It is recommended to install all of these dashboards.
